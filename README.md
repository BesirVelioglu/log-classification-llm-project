# Log Classification With Hybrid Classification Framework

This project implements a hybrid log classification system, combining three complementary approaches to handle varying levels of complexity in log patterns. The classification methods ensure flexibility and effectiveness in processing predictable, complex, and poorly-labeled data patterns.

## Classification Approaches

**Regular Expression (Regex):**
- Handles the most simplified and predictable patterns.
- Useful for patterns that are easily captured using predefined rules.

**Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression:**
- Manages complex patterns when there is sufficient training data.
- Utilizes embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers and applies Logistic Regression as the classification layer.

**LLM (Large Language Models):**
- Used for handling complex patterns when sufficient labeled training data is not available.
- Provides a fallback or complementary approach to the other methods.


## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn server:app --reload
   ```

3. Access the API:
   - Main endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   - Swagger UI:      http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
   - ReDoc:           http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
```

## Usage

Upload a CSV file containing logs to the `/classify` endpoint (must have `source` and `log_message` columns). The response is a CSV with an added `target_label` column.
